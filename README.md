# Learning Quantum Programming
This repo primarily contains Jeremy's experiments for the QCEngine quantum simulator that is part of the _Programming Quantum Computers_ book from O'Reilly.  

I'm going through this book as part of a book club started by Lynn Langit and I. More information about the club and recordings are available from Lynn's repository.
